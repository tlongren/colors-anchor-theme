#Colors

A colorful, minimal (and responsive) theme for [AnchorCMS](http://anchorcms.com). You can see it in action at the [VPSstat.us Blog](http://blog.vpsstat.us).

---

##Why
[VPSstat.us is bust](http://blog.vpsstat.us/posts/open-sourcing-our-solusvm-monitor-and-closing). So, figured I'd release the AnchorCMS theme to the community.

##Usage

1. Copy the theme folder into your Anchor site's `themes` directory via FTP
2. Activate the theme in the Admin area -> Extend -> Metadata
3. Enjoy!

##Issues
I'll be cleaning this up lots over the next few weeks, so hang off on reporting issues until this is gone from the readme. Thanks!

##How to Contribute
1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
