1. Copy your logo file to the theme's `img` directory
2. Open `functions.php`

1. Copy your header image to the theme's `img` directory
2. Open `functions.php`
3. Modify line 67 with the name of your header image

##Icons
Icons are provided by [Genericons.](http://genericons.com) A little ironic, I know. You may use any of the icons available from that site. However, instead of using `<i class="genericon-[iconName]"></i>` use `<i class="icon-[iconName]"></i>`
